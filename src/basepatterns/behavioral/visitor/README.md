**The visitor design pattern** is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates.
A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existent object structures
 without modifying the structures.
 
The purpose of a Visitor pattern is to define a new operation without introducing the modifications
 to an existing object structure([link](https://www.baeldung.com/java-visitor-pattern)).
