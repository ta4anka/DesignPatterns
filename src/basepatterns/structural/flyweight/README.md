**Flyweight pattern**( [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flyweight-design-pattern/) )
is one of the structural design patterns as this pattern provides ways to decrease object
count thus improving application required objects structure.
Flyweight pattern is used when we need to create a large number of similar objects (say 10 to the fifth power).
One important feature of flyweight objects is that they are `immutable`. 
This means that they cannot be modified once they have been constructed.
You just reuse the same once created instance.
